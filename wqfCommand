$ ./configure --enable-debug
to configure in  /usr/local etc // need to sudo

--- run ---

run munge
Make sure that all nodes in your cluster have the same munge.key. 
Make sure the MUNGE daemon, munged is started before you start the Slurm daemons.

run manually
$ su
$ munged
$ sudo munged --stop // vital to do so

type
$ sudo slurmctld -D
run controler daemon 

type
$ sudo slurmd -D
run computer daemon

type
$ srun ~/sattach_midout/build/sleeper
$ scancel x.x   

FILE AND DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS
There are three classes of files: Files used by slurmctld must be accessible by user SlurmUser and accessible by the primary and backup control machines. Files used by slurmd must be accessible by user root and accessible from every compute node. A few files need to be accessible by normal users on all login and compute nodes. While many files and directories are listed below, most of them will not be used with most configurations.
